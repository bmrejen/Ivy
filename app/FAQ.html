				<h2 class="h4">Why France?</h2>
				<p>France has one of the most prestigious education systems in the world. France is one of the world's top destinations
					for international students around the world. The 5 best Masters in Finance in the world are in France. The top 1 and
					top 4 business schools in the world are in France.Out of the Top 50 business schools in the world, 17 of them are in
					France. Out of the top 3 MBAs in the world, 2 of them are in France, right behind Harvard University.</p>
				<p>France is also one of the world's top destinations for teaching, languages, arts, history, law, medicine, nuclear
					energy, aviation and space. France is the 2nd most attractive country to study for international students behind Canada.
					90% of international students are satisfied of their education.</p>
				<p>Finally, studying in France is very cheap. Public universities cost around 300 EUR a year, whereas even the best business
					schools take around 10,000 EUR a year, which is 6 to 15 times less than a similar degree in the USA or in Canada.</p>

				<div class="divider"></div>

				<h2 class="h4">Why are you better?</h2>
				<p>You can find many agencies that help you go study in France in Shanghai. But most of them just do a little more than
					dealing with the paperwork. At Académie de France, we take your success very seriously. That's why all our teachers
					are jury members who actually select the candidates who get accepted in France's best business schools. With us, you
					get training from the best of the best.</p>

				<div class="divider"></div>

				<h2 class="h4">Do I need to come from a good university?</h2>
				<p>Coming from a good university helps but it is not mandatory. French universities and schools want to see open and
					curious people who are ready to discover and try new things. Showing these qualities in your resume and interview are
					way more decisive than your academic record.</p>

				<div class="divider"></div>

				<h2 class="h4">Can I change majors?</h2>
				<p>It depends. If you apply for a public university, it is easier if you come from the same major. However, private schools
					know that it is sometimes hard to know what you want to do so early in your life and they are open to people from all
					academic backgrounds. But be careful, the school and the embassy will both pay very strong attention to your motivation
					letter to make sure that your study plan has been carefully pondered. We can help you writing the perfect motivation
					letter.
				</p>

				<div class="divider"></div>

				<h2 class="h4">Should I go to a public university or a private school?</h2>
				<p>Public universities have always been France's elite education. They are perfect for engineers, especially in aviation,
					aerospace, nuclear power, automobiles, high-speed rail, high-end manufacturing, and software industry.</p>
				<p>However, in business, the best academic centers of business education are private schools. The top private schools
					are HEC, ESSEC, ESCP, EMLYON, EDHEC and SKEMA. In arts both exist - architecture, applied arts, graphic design, clothing
					design, film, music, dance, theatrical arts are extremely high-level in France, as well as luxury management, hotel
					and wine management.</p>

				<div class="divider"></div>

				<h2 class="h4">Do I need to speak French?</h2>
				<p>No, most business schools and universities don't require you to speak French as they have programs for international
					students in English. This being said, speaking French is of course a great asset. Some art schools might ask you to
					have a B1 level at the TCF exam. We can help you with that.</p>

				<div class="divider"></div>

				<h2 class="h4">Do I need to take an English test? Which one?</h2>
				<p>Most universities will require either a TOEIC, IELTS or a TOEFL. Our instructors are skilled at teaching each one
					of these tests.</p>

				<div class="divider"></div>

				<h2 class="h4">Which are the best majors to study in France?</h2>
				<p>France is famous for the excellency of its business schools. In 2018, the top 5 Masters in Finance in the world are
					all French schools.</p>

				<div class="divider"></div>

				<h2 class="h4">Can I still study in a good university if I don't have a GMAT score?</h2>
				<p>Yes, but some schools will require you to take a GMAT, GRE, CAT or Tagemage, depending on the school. We can give
					you special training for each one of these tests.</p>

				<div class="divider"></div>

				<h2 class="h4">Can you help me get a visa?</h2>
				<p>Yes, once you get accepted, we will give you guidance and make sure you have the best chances to have your visa application
					accepted.
				</p>

				<div class="divider"></div>

				<h2 class="h4">Can you help me get a scholarship?</h2>
				<p>Yes, there are 4 types of scholarships you can get in France. France has a huge number of scholarships for all kinds
					of students, including international students. Many Chinese students in law, economics, engineering can get the Eiffel
					scholarship, which covers a stipend, medical insurance, travel insurance and access to cultural activities. The government
					also has many scholarships for international and Chinese students through the French embassy. There are also any regional
					scholarships given by the Paris Region, Rhône region and the region where you are studying. Last but not least, the
					school you apply to also has scholarships for many of its international students.</p>
				<p>In all cases, we will give you guidance and help getting one or more scholarships.</p>

				<div class="divider"></div>

				<h2 class="h4">Who are the interviewers?</h2>
				<p>Interviews are usually given by a group of 2 to 4 interviewers who are alumni of the schools you are applying for.
					Some of them work for the school but the majority of them are professionals in their field who have accepted to give
					some of their time to select the best candidates for their school. They do not pay a lot of attention to the candidate's
					academic background but they want to meet and talk to them to understand who they are and whether their academic choices
					are the best for them and for the school.</p>
